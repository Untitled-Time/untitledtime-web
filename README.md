# Untitled Time: The Space Where the Tree Outlives the Rocket

> "We are building ships to escape Earth because we have forgotten how to sit still upon it."

## The Thesis
We are currently witnessing two simultaneous accelerations: the **Artemis II** mission, representing our urge to exit the cradle of Earth, and the **Post-Labor Era**, where algorithms render human utility obsolete. 

**Untitled Time** is an interdisciplinary inquiry and a physical proposal. It is a "Vessel" designed to hold human meaning for 100 years. If the rocket is a machine built for escape, this Vessel is a technology built for *stewardship*. It asks a singular, burning question: 

**In 2126, when the algorithms have long since finished our work, what will we have saved that is worth reading?**

## Why This Matters (The Executive Case)

### 1. The Crisis of Patience (Templeton Inquiry)
The John Templeton Foundation seeks to understand "Human Flourishing." True flourishing requires a temporal horizon longer than a fiscal quarter or a political cycle. We are experiencing a "crisis of patience." By creating a project that matures only in a century, we force a return to "Deep Time"—the only scale on which spiritual and character virtues truly grow.

### 2. The Archive as Active Agent (Mellon Framework)
The Mellon Foundation champions "Public Knowledge." Traditionally, archives are where thoughts go to rest. **Untitled Time** reimagines the archive as an active, living participant in the community. Drawing inspiration from the *Future Library* in Oslo, we treat the W&M College Woods and Special Collections not as a warehouse, but as a "Slow Vessel" for the next century of public thought.

## The Architecture of the Vessel

This project is structured as a three-phase intellectual "Startup for the Soul":

* **Phase I: The Anchor (2026)**
    Confronting the "Rocket" (the urge to leave) vs. the "Algorithm" (the urge to be replaced). Defining the "Earthly Values" that cannot be digitized.
* **Phase II: The Form (2026-2027)**
    A collaboration between Physics, Art, Biology, and Philosophy to design the physical Vessel—a structure built to withstand the elements and the erosion of human attention for 100 years.
* **Phase III: The Framework (Long-Term)**
    Establishing a **Centennial Trust** and a Trans-Atlantic pedagogical bridge (Scotland to Norway) to study how different cultures steward their "Deep Past" to protect their "Deep Future."

## The Architects
An unprecedented convergence of disciplines at the College of William & Mary:
* **Ran Yang (Physics):** Systems integration, thermodynamics of time, and the "Wu Wei" of non-action.
* **Elizabeth Mead (Art):** Sculptural form and the materiality of permanence.
* **Camille Andrews (Libraries):** Stewardship and the preservation of the "human record."
* **Jon Pineda (English):** The narrative arc of the next century.
* **Harmony Dalgleish (Biology):** Arboreal time and ecological resilience.
* **Monica Seger (Italian Studies/ENSP):** The environmental humanities and memory.
* **Jonah Goldwater (Philosophy):** Metaphysics and the definition of the "Human" in post-labor.
