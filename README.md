# Untitled Time: The Space Where the Tree Outlives the Rocket

> "We are building ships to escape Earth because we have forgotten how to sit still upon it."

## The Thesis
We are currently witnessing two simultaneous accelerations: the **Artemis II** mission, representing our urge to exit the cradle of Earth, and the **Post-Labor Era**, where algorithms render human utility obsolete. 

**Untitled Time** is an interdisciplinary inquiry and a physical proposal. It is a "Vessel" designed to hold human meaning for 100 years. If the rocket is a machine built for escape, this Vessel is a technology built for *stewardship*. It asks a singular, burning question: 

**In 2126, when the algorithms have long since finished our work, what will we have saved that is worth reading?**

## The Three Dimensions of Inquiry

### 1. The Existential Dimension: Human Flourishing in Deep Time
The "Crisis of Patience" is not a technical problem; it is a spiritual one. True human flourishing requires a temporal horizon longer than a fiscal quarter or a political cycle. By architecting a project that matures only in a century, we force a return to "Deep Time"—the only scale on which character, virtue, and legacy truly grow. We are asking what it means to be human when we are no longer defined by our labor.

### 2. The Institutional Dimension: The Archive as an Active Agent
In the 21st century, libraries and archives are often treated as "warehouses of the past." **Untitled Time** reimagines the archive as an active, living vessel. Drawing inspiration from the *Future Library* in Oslo, we treat the William & Mary College Woods and Special Collections as a "Slow Vessel." We are not just storing knowledge; we are stewarding a 100-year conversation between the present and a future we will never see.

### 3. The Socio-Economic Dimension: The Post-Labor Mandate
As AI and automation decouple "income" from "meaning," humanity faces a dignity vacuum. If the 20th century was about the speed of the Rocket (escape), the 21st century must be about the roots of the Tree (stewardship). This project provides the intellectual and physical infrastructure for a society that must learn to find value in stillness and long-duration thinking.

## The Architecture of the Vessel

This project is structured as a three-phase intellectual "Startup for the Soul":

* **Phase I: The Anchor (2026)**
    Confronting the "Rocket" (the urge to leave) vs. the "Algorithm" (the urge to be replaced). Defining the "Earthly Values" that cannot be digitized.
* **Phase II: The Form (2026-2027)**
    A collaboration between Physics, Art, Biology, and Philosophy to design the physical Vessel—a structure built to withstand the elements and the erosion of human attention for 100 years.
* **Phase III: The Framework (Long-Term)**
    Establishing a **Centennial Trust** and a Trans-Atlantic pedagogical bridge (Scotland to Norway) to study how different cultures steward their "Deep Past" to protect their "Deep Future."

## The Architects
An unprecedented convergence of disciplines at the College of William & Mary:
* **Ran Yang (Physics):** Systems integration, thermodynamics of time, and the "Wu Wei" of non-action.
* **Elizabeth Mead (Art):** Sculptural form and the materiality of permanence.
* **Camille Andrews (Libraries):** Stewardship and the preservation of the "human record."
* **Jon Pineda (English):** The narrative arc of the next century.
* **Harmony Dalgleish (Biology):** Arboreal time and ecological resilience.
* **Monica Seger (Italian Studies/ENSP):** The environmental humanities and memory.
* **Jonah Goldwater (Philosophy):** Metaphysics and the definition of the "Human" in post-labor.
