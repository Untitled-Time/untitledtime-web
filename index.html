                <h2>The Crisis of Patience</h2>
                <p>It is February 8th, 2026. On Launch Pad 39B, the Artemis II rocket stands as a white obelisk against the Florida sky. It is built to escape.</p>
                <p>Simultaneously, we have entered the "Post-Labor" era. Algorithms now code, diagnose, and create. In a world where work—the traditional source of human dignity—is gone, we are left with a haunting question: <em>What do we do all day?</em></p>

                <h2>The Anti-Rocket</h2>
                <p>Silicon Valley is built on disruption. NASA is built on escape. <strong>Untitled Time</strong> is a proposal to build a "Vessel" at William & Mary—the Deep Time institution of the nation.</p>
                <p>Drawing inspiration from the Future Library in Oslo, where spruce saplings grow for a century to become books no one living today will read, we propose a physical and intellectual space that projects humanity 100 years into the future.</p>
                <p>We are asserting that in 2126, there will still be a "We" to read them.</p>
